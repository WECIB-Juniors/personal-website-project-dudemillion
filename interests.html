                <h3>Game Development</h3>
                <p>
                    Ever since my childhood, I loved video games. Always surrounded by them, starting with
                    the simple <strong>Wii</strong>, moving to the 3DS, PS3, the Wii U, PS4, Nintendo Switch, PS5, I've
                    had a lot of gaming consoles at my disposal. I like to see <strong>people having fun</strong>,
                    especially with the things that <strong>I've made</strong>, and that is why I have taken interest
                    to this.

                <h3>Software Development</h3>
                <p>
                    Of course, it <em>isn't easy</em> to become a game developer all things considered. You have
                    to make ideas, flesh out the gameplay, make sure its enjoyable, etc. So a more general
                    option being software development is also an interest for me. It's in the <strong>same ballpark</strong>
                    as game development, so I feel like I'd enjoy this type of thing.

                <h3>Golf</h3>
                <p>
                    My first experience with golf was at a <em>Frankie's</em>, me and my family went to their
                    mini-golf section and played there. <strong>That's where I discovered my liking to golf.</strong>
                    Me and my family now often visit ranges like <em>Top Golf</em> and <em>Drive Shack</em> for some
                    good fun.

                <h3>Roblox Animation</h3>
                <p>
                    This one is more of a recent finding for me. I took an interest to <strong>animation</strong>, as
                    I am a <em>Roblox</em> player who owns the popular animation tool, <strong>Moon Animator</strong>, and I
                    was encouraged by friends to learn it and make stuff with it. So now I like
                    to make animations in Roblox Studio for different games I play and sometimes post
                    my animations on YouTube.

                <h3>Cubing</h3>
                <p>
                    Cubing, otherwise known as solving rubick's cubes, is something I also like to do
                    in my free time. I have a few <em>speedcubes</em> (GAN) and some other weird puzzles like one
                    that has its colors only appear by applying heat (rub your hands on it). I average 
                    about <strong>1 minute and 20 seconds</strong> to solve a rubick's cube.
