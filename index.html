    <section class="Bio">
        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            As of November 2025, I am a <strong>junior</strong> attending at the Wake Early College of Information
            and Biotechnologies, as well as being <strong>dual-enrolled</strong> with Wake Technical Community
            College. I currently maintain an unweighted <strong>4.0 GPA</strong> and have attained a multitude
            of tech-related certifications. Certifications such as the <em>CompTIA IT Fundamentals,
            PCAP, Microsoft Office Associate, etc.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a few plans for the future. After graduating from WECIB, either with or
            without an associate's degree, <strong>I plan to go to college.</strong> My dream college, obviously
            being an ivy league, is <em>MIT</em>, as they specialize in IT and other tech-related fields.
            I plan to take on a career in IT, specifically in software development or game
            development. Although recently I have been <strong>reconsidering</strong> my plans as the new
            developments of AI has made me <strong>doubt</strong> the necesity of new software developers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pursuing AI development is likely to be quite the lucrative field, as that is
            all the rage as of late. ChatGPT, for example, has gotten really advanced over
            the years. Remember, ChatGPT was only released in <strong>2022</strong>, and see how far it has
            come. It used to be clueless, and hallucinate all the time. But now, <em>it has 
            become something so much more than anyone anticipated.</em> This is why AI has
            become a new consideration when it comes to my future career.

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Finance Assistant</strong></li>
            <p>
                This is a tool that I created to help you manage your expenses. I trained a ML
                model with a dataset with a multitude of expenses and made it learn patterns 
                in spending to forecast future expenses.
            </p>
            <li><strong>PrimeTime Cooking Simulator</strong></li>
            <p>
                This was a game I made for a class game jam alongside my partner Treyvon.
                This is a game where you can cook burgers, fry fries, grab drinks, and
                serve them to customers.
            </p>
            <li><strong>Fake News Identifier</strong></li>
            <p>
                This is another ML project I worked on, where I taught a model to recognize
                patterns in the language of fake news articles vs. real ones to differentiate
                the two.
