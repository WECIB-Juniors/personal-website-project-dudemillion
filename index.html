                <p>
                    As of November 2025, I am a <strong>junior</strong> attending at the Wake Early College of Information
                    and Biotechnologies, as well as being <strong>dual-enrolled</strong> with Wake Technical Community
                    College. I currently maintain an unweighted <strong>4.0 GPA</strong> and have attained a multitude
                    of tech-related certifications. Certifications such as the <em>CompTIA IT Fundamentals,
                    PCAP, Microsoft Office Associate, etc.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a few plans for the future. After graduating from WECIB, either with or
                    without an associate's degree, <strong>I plan to go to college.</strong> My dream college, obviously
                    being an ivy league, is <em>MIT</em>, as they specialize in IT and other tech-related fields.
                    I plan to take on a career in IT, specifically in software development or game
                    development. Although recently I have been <strong>reconsidering</strong> my plans as the new
                    developments of AI has made me <strong>doubt</strong> the necesity of new software developers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pursuing AI development is likely to be quite the lucrative field, as that is
                    all the rage as of late. ChatGPT, for example, has gotten really advanced over
                    the years. Remember, ChatGPT was only released in <strong>2022</strong>, and see how far it has
                    come. It used to be clueless, and hallucinate all the time. But now, <em>it has 
                    become something so much more than anyone anticipated.</em> This is why AI has
                    become a new consideration when it comes to my future career.

                <h3>Personal Finance Assistant</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a tool that I created to help you manage your expenses. I trained a ML model with a dataset 
                    containing many expenses and made it learn spending patterns to forecast future expenses.

                <h3>PrimeTime Cooking Simulator</h3>
                <p>
                    This was a game I made for a class game jam alongside my partner Treyvon. You can cook burgers, fry fries, 
                    grab drinks, and serve them to customers.

                <h3>Fake News Identifier</h3>
                <p>
                    This is an ML project where I taught a model to recognize patterns in the language of fake news articles 
                    vs. real ones to differentiate the two.
